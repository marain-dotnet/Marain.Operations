# Release notes for Marain.Operations v4.

## v4.0

Now using `Marain.TenantManagement` v3.

Note, we were already using V3-style Service Manifests in v3.0, so this shouldn't change anything from the perspective of applications using Claims, either in how they configure it, or how clients communicate with it.
