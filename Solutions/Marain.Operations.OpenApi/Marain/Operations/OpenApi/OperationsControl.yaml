    This API is used by services that implement long-running operations to define and update
    operations reported through the Operations Status API. E.g., consider some service called
    SlowService which provides an operation DoSlowWork, in which clients invoke the operation with
    an HTTP POST to https://slowservice.marain.net/api/DoSlowWork and this endpoint conforms to the
    long-running operation spec at https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#1322-post
    as amended by https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/pull/101 - the DoSlowWork should
    provide an HTTP response with a status code of 202, and a Location header referring to a
    resource representing the operation, as provided by the Operations Status API, e.g.
    https://operationsstatus.marain.net/api/operationsstatus/{opId} where {opId} is the unique
    identifier of the operation. For that Location URL to work, the DoSlowWork service must first
    create the operation using this Operations Control API's CreateOperation operation. This
    provides the URL for the operation in its Location header, which the DoSlowWork service can
    then return in its own Location header. The client of the DoSlowWork service can then use this
    to track the progress of the operation. Meanwhile, the SlowService can update what that client
    will see using the other operations provided by this Operations Control API. When work
    commences, it will use SetOperationRunning to move it from the "Not Started" state into the
    "Running" state, and it may optionally call this repeatedly, providing the percentComplete
    parameter to indicate what proportion of the work is complete. When the operation finishes,
    the SlowService will use either the SetOperationFailed or SetOperationSucceeded operation of
    this Operations Control API to indicate the final outcome.
    Note that the endpoints don't protect against concurrent requests to update a single operation;
    should this happen, the last message processed will always take precedence.'
