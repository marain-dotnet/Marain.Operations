    // If instead you point TenancyClient:TenancyServiceBaseUri at an instance in Azure, this local service will need to

    //
    // And for that to work, you won't be able to use tne normal az cli-based AzureServicesAuthConnectionString
    // (because az cli is only able to obtain tokens for a fixed set of known Microsoft resource; it can't be
    // used to obtain tokens for arbitrary applications that we've defined). Instead, you'll need to create
    // a suitable service principle in AAD, grant that service principle access to the tenancy service, and
    // set up the credentials like this instead of the setting above:
    //  "AzureServicesAuthConnectionString": "RunAs=App;AppId=AppIdForYourServicePrinciple;TenantId=0f621c67-98a0-4ed5-b5bd-31a35be41e29;AppKey=YourAppSecretHere"
    // If your tenant is configured to get storage connection info from KeyVault, you'll also need the above set to and the
    // appropriate service principal granted access to the KeyVault in question.
